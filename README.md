JavaScript Object Oriented Programming
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a style of programming that uses classes and objects to model real-world things like data and behavior. A class is a blueprint that defines the properties and methods an object can have, while an object is a specific instance created from that class.

Why OOP is Needed:

Before OOP, when the code size grows and multiple people work on a project, there problems arise

Changing in one team's code causing other codes to break. Hence difficult to maintain.
Large number of parameters during function calls.
Difficult to divide and maintain code across teams.
Limited Code Reusability
Not scalable as the code is not modular.
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) solves these problems by combining data and the functions that operate on it into a single unit called an object. This approach has following main features

Encapsulation ensures that one team can change data representation and algorithms without causing other team's code change.
Inheritance ensures code reuse.
Polymorphism allows objects to behave differently using the same interface .
OOPs-Concepts
Objects
In JavaScript, an object is a collection of data (properties) and actions (methods) stored as key–value pairs.

Properties hold values like strings, numbers, or even other objects.
Methods are functions inside the object that define what it can do.
Objects let you group related data and functionality together in one place.

Classes
In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and methods. A class itself doesn’t hold values, it describes what an object should have and do. You create actual objects from a class using the new keyword.


Abstraction
Abstraction is one of the key features of object-oriented programming in JavaScript. It means showing only the essential information and hiding unnecessary details from the user. Data abstraction refers to exposing only what is necessary to interact with the object while keeping the background details or internal logic hidden.

Encapsulation
Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up data and information under a single unit. In Object-Oriented Programming, encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them together in a class.

Inheritance
The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.

Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or Derived Class.
Super Class: The class whose properties are inherited by a sub-class is called Base Class or Superclass.

Polymorphism
The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of an entity to behave different in different scenarios. person at the same time can have different characteristics.
